    ## Data Description
    
    The synthetic dataset contains:
    - Daily sales records for 10 stores
    - 5 product categories
    - 1 year of historical data (2023)
    - Features: promotions, holidays, time-based features
    - Target: daily sales amount
    
    ## How to Use This Project
    
    1. **Explore the data**: Open the Jupyter notebook in OpenShift Data Science
    2. **Train the model**: Run all cells in the notebook
    3. **Deploy to OpenShift**:
       - Build a container image with the model
       - Create a KServe InferenceService
       - Set up monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
    
    ## OpenShift Components Used
    
    - **OpenShift Data Science**: For Jupyter notebooks and model development
    - **OpenShift Pipelines**: For CI/CD automation
    - **KServe**: For model serving
    - **OpenShift Monitoring**: For tracking model performance
    - **Persistent Storage**: For data and model artifacts
    
    ## Next Steps
    
    1. Containerize the model serving application
    2. Create Tekton pipelines for automated retraining
    3. Set up model performance monitoring
    4. Implement A/B testing for model updates
